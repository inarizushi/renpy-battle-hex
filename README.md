renpy-battle-hex
================

Battle system to be used with renpy

To run renpy-battle-hex, download renpy here:
www.renpy.org/latest.html 

Then clone this project into your renpy projects directory.

Goals
----------------
Learn Renpy and somehow integrate a hex map (hopefully 3d if we get that far) battle system into the game-play. It will probably involve using Renpygame.
